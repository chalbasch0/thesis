# Thesis - Sentiment Analysis on Data Privacy Via Twitter API
Welcome to my thesis page! Here you'll find a repository of different code I used to interact with the twitter API, natural language processing for sentiment analysis, and a couple other data visualizations I made for use in my write-up. If you have any questions or would like to learn more, feel free to reach out @chrishalbasch@gmail.com.

Thanks for viewing!
